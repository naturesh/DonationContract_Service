### ðŸ’¸ How donations are delivered and managed

     1. Donation Preparation: First, create a personal wallet on the platform and deposit Polygon (POL) tokens for the amount you wish to donate.
     
     2. Select Donation Target & Execute: Choose an organization in need and make your donation.
     
     3. Fund Distribution:
     
         Platform Operation Fee (2%): 
            2% of the donation is used for stable platform operation and feature improvements. This applies equally to all [Individual -> Organization] donations only.
            
         Separation of Organization's 'Operating Funds' and 'Pure Donations':
         
            The amount after deducting fees is divided into two types of funds according to the ratio previously set and disclosed by the organization.
            
            Operating Funds: Goes to the organization's 'Operating Fund Wallet' to be used for operational costs necessary for maintaining and managing the organization's activities. 
               These funds can be directly withdrawn and used by the organization.
               
            Pure Donations: The remaining amount goes to the organization's 'Pure Donation Wallet'. 
               These 'Pure Donations' cannot be directly withdrawn by the organization like cash.

**Final Delivery of Pure Donations**:
   *   The funds in the 'Pure Donation Wallet' held by the organization are **designed to be used only in the form of re-donating to final individual beneficiaries.**
   *   This ensures that donations are not used for other purposes in the middle and increases the possibility of reaching those in need, securing stability.
   *   In case of organization -> organization fund transfers for re-delegation between supporting organizations, **Pure Donations** are again distributed into the delegated organization's **Operating Funds** and **Pure Donations**.

**Donation Proof (NFT Issuance)**:

    When all donations (both to individuals/organizations) are completed, donors receive a unique NFT-format digital donation certificate called `DNCT`. This certificate is permanently recorded on the blockchain to prove the donation.

### Key Advantages of DonationContract Platform

1.  **Clear Fund Separation & Management (For Organization Donations)**:
    *   Amounts donated to organizations are transparently separated into 'Operating Funds' and 'Pure Donations' according to pre-agreed ratios.
    *   Donors can clearly know how much operating expenses the organization uses for actual activities and how much is purely used for helping others.

2.  **Enhanced Stability of Donation Usage**:
    *   'Pure Donations' received by organizations cannot be directly withdrawn and are designed to be used ultimately for delivery to individual beneficiaries, preventing misuse of donations and aiming for stable delivery.

3.  **Blockchain-based Transparency**:
    *   All donations, fund distributions, and (organizational) re-donation details are recorded as 'event logs' on the blockchain.
    *   These records are public and can be verified by anyone, so donors can track and confirm the entire flow of how their donations are delivered.

4.  **Permanent Donation Proof (NFT)**:
    *   The issued NFT donation certificate is safely stored on the blockchain, allowing you to prove your donation and reflect on its meaning anytime, anywhere.

5.  **Sustainable Platform Operation**:
    *   The 2% fee generated from organization donations is used to stably maintain and develop the platform, contributing to connecting more donors and beneficiaries in the long term.

### QNA

1. Malicious repeated re-delegation by supporting organizations
    * Complete transparency through event logs becomes a strong factor in deterring malicious re-delegation behavior, especially for supporting organizations that value reputation and recognition.
    * The 2% fee policy applies only when organizations receive money. This is designed to create disadvantages when organizations engage in repeated malicious re-delegation behavior.
